Despite the promise of federated learning to build models without compromising user privacy, many existing FL testbeds fall short when faced with real-world challenges. This work critically examines current experimental setups—highlighting issues such as unrealistic datasets, limited heterogeneity, and inadequate environmental control—and proposes a context-aware assessment framework that better reflects practical deployment scenarios.
