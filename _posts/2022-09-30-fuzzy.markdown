Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving alternative to centralized machine learning. However, most FL frameworks and assessments are based on simulations, unrealistic datasets, and lack the heterogeneity and environmental controls needed for large-scale, real-world deployment. RealFL is an open-source, extendable platform that addresses these limitations by enabling realistic control over network conditions, client churn, data distribution, and training complexity.
